# Big Game Hunters mod for Zero-K

This module makes zero-k resemble the Big Game Hunters maps from
Starcraft: resources are unlimited and plentiful.

The mod works by tweaking the Mex overdrive system; it now grows
linearly with excess energy, rather than by the square-root of excess
energy.

Map control no longer matters: Your metal economy is basically a
function of your energy economy.  A single mex will produce as much
metal as will dozens.  Turtle hard comrade.
